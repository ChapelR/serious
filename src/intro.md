description: What is Serious?
---
Serious is simple a framework for writing serialized web fiction. Authors write episodes in markdown format, and Serious builds these episodes into a simple, client side web app. 

In Serious, simple is the name of the game: a reading and writing system that stays out of the way and lets the content speak for itself. You don't need to be a developer to use Serious (though knowing what you're doing can only help), and it makes reading through your episodes, in order, easy. 

## Why Use Serious? 

Serious has *less* functionality than most blogging software, but is designed specifically for web serials, meaning its features and design are all about making ordered, episodic content. No tags, suggestions, archives, or blog rolls, just quick access to the first episode, the latest episode, and an episode list. 

Authors can also create `meta` pages, like about pages, and can add links to the side menu for things like blog posts, forums, etc, all with only a few edits to the configuration options. 

Serious comes with a handful of visual themes to choose from, and writing your own is simple if you know a bit of CSS.
