This is an **example episode**!

Welcome to Serious. To create episodes, you create a heading block like the one at the top of this file, then write your *markdown format content* after that.

Serious supports [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which allows you  
- to  
- create  
- lists  

> or block quotes

```javascript
function () {
    return "or code fences";
}
```

## Or headings.

And really, a lot of other stuff.
